## Application Overview

Discovering new video games and navigating online storefronts full of jargon can be an overwhelming and frustrating experience for people who have little to no experience with gaming. Plug N Play is a web application designed to help users who are new to the video game atmosphere view game recommendations that are tailored to their personal interests. Plug N Play will provide the ability to personalize recommendations appropriately based on a questionnaire taken upon registering.

Plug N Play is powered by [Rawg.io](http://www.rawg.io/)'s API service, which allows us to search their database of over 800,000 games. Of their available 9,800 search tags, we have hand-picked a little over 200 tags to use as search terms and user scores to power our search algorithm. Upon registering for a new account, a new user will fill out a survey. For each question, the user is asked to rate their preferences on a 9-point spectrum. Upon completing the survey, these answers will be processed and turned into user scores, which will inform future recommendations. This survey should only be completed once, but the algorithm will continue to be adjusted when users rate games in their "played" list.
